            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem
             of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling,
             like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer
                  needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.Visual Studio Code is a free coding editor that helps you start coding quickly. We can use it to code in any programming language, 
                  without switching editors. Visual Studio Code has support for many languages, including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more. </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>It allows you to sync pretty much everything you customize on VSCode to Github, from settings to keyboard shortcuts to other VSCode extensions.
                            This way, you'll have access to your preferred IDE from whichever device you want, instead of having 
                            to program from a vanilla VSCode environment on new devices or having to manually set up everything again.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Live Server launches a local development server with a live reload feature both for static and dynamic pages.Every time you save your code, you'll instantly see the changes reflected in the browser. 
                            You'll be much faster at spotting errors and it's much easier to do some quick experiments with your code.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Developed by Microsoft, Debugger for Chrome allows you to debug your JS 
                            code in VSCode. Contrary to debuggers in other IDEs, it's surprisingly smooth.You can set breakpoints, step your way through the code, debug scripts added dynamically, and more.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that works particularly well if you have multiple people working on a single project, because the extension enforces a consistent style.

                            You can set it up so it formats your code every time you save it, significantly reducing the amount of time you need to spend formatting your code.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Although VSCode has line numbers, Bookmarks allows you to add bookmarks to your code, helping you quickly navigate and easily jump back and forth.

                            Additionally, it allows you to select regions of code between bookmarked code, which is quite useful for something like log file analysis.
